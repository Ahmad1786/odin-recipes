    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Bizarrely interesting dish featured in one of the greatest shows "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."
    <br>Apparently consists of hot steaming milk poured over some delicious steak with a side of jelly beans!
    <br>I will NEVER EVER try this but I hope you do! And I would also highly recommend the show. <br> Here is one of
    the hilarious scenes and features the recipe at the end: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tUX4tQ6m7U">Charlie's date - Milk steak!</a>

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak of choice (highly recommend some Strip Steak!)</li>
        <li>Milk of choice (highly recommend good old cow milk!)</li>
        <li>Pack of Jelly Beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring Milk to a boil</li>
        <li>Cut prepared steak around in the middle. It is highly recommended 
          <br>to only have the steak lightly seasoned to truly appreciate the flavors!</li>
        <li>Pour over the milk</li>
        <li>Generously garnish with some Jelly Beans</li>
    </ol>
