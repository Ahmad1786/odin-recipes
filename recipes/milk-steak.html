    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Bizarrely interesting dish featured in one of the greatest shows "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."
    <br>Apparently consists of hot steaming milk poured over some delicious steak with a side of jelly beans!
    <br>I will NEVER EVER try this but I hope you do! And I would also highly recommend the show. <br> Here is one of
    the hilarious scenes and features the recipe at the end: <a class="a-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tUX4tQ6m7U">Charlie's date - Milk steak!</a>
